          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Big 🍓 Strawberry Toys is a family-owned business that has been
            around since...right now! It's the 🧠 🧒🏾 of a 🧒🏾 named Lily. She has
            been making toys since she was a little and has taught her trade to
            a few elves 🧝🏾‍♂️.
          </p>

          <p>
            Don't worry. She's not competing with 🎅🏾. But while the jolly fellow
            is gearing up throughout the year for the big day, Lily and Big 🍓
            Strawberry Toys is here to 🚢 out custom toys for your little one.
          </p>

          <p>
            We thank you for checking us out and hope you'll invite us into your
            homes and entrust us with helping nurture and develop your most
            precious young.
