        <p>
          Big 🍓 Strawberry Toys is a family-owned business that has been around
          since...right now! It's the brain child of a child named Lily. She has
          been making toys since she was a little and has taught her trade to a
          few elves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't worry. She's not competing with 🎅🏾. But while the jolly fellow
          is gearing up throughout the year for the big day, Lily and Big 🍓
          Strawberry Toys is here. Or selection is small but our handcrafted
          quality is second to none.
